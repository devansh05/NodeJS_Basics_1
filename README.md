# NodeJS_Basics_1
This is a repo for basics of node js. This repo is to learn Modules, Express File Systems, NPM and more.
Basic commands :
node init //to create the project
node nameOfFile.js // to run the file in npm
npm install packageName // to install package or libraries

We can set entry point in package.json for our project
Node works on a single thread and uses threads indirectly in background to complete tasks
It is not recommended to use calculation intensive tasks on Node as it has only one single thread
